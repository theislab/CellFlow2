# `scaleflow.dagloader` — declarative, index-free sampling over annbatch

A small, declarative layer that turns a **scheme of columns + weights** into a stream of matched
`{source, target, condition}` training batches, read (in- or out-of-core) through
[`annbatch`](https://github.com/laminlabs/annbatch). It is the streaming sampler that both
**cellflow** (this repo's model) and **sc-flow-tools** (`theislab/sc-flow-tools`) can share: one
condition per batch, source↔target matching, categorical + continuous condition payloads, and
reproducible weighted sampling — expressed as data, not as materialized row-index tables.

```

        │                                                 │
        └───────────────────► DAGClassLoader ◄────────────┘

        ├─ every node streams through its own ScheduledClassSampler + annbatch.Loader
        └─ root category ~ weights; each bound child's category derived from the parent's
```

Structure (`Scheme`) and read parameters (`SamplerConfig`) are separate objects, both handed to the
loader — so the same scheme can run with different batch/chunk settings, and neither lives on the
`Node`.

---

## 1. Mental model

- **Source** — a named cell store: an in-memory `AnnData` **or** an out-of-core
  `annbatch.DatasetCollection`. The loader never branches on which; obs is read for grouping, cells
  are read only when a batch is materialized.
- **Node** — a partition of *one source's* cells into **leaves** = the unique combinations of its
  `cols`, plus a `{combo: weight}` mapping. `cols` are the grouping / condition columns; `key` is the
  single representation to stream (`"X"`, `"obsm/X_pca"`, `"layers/…"`) — add another node for another
  rep. The `Node` carries no read parameters; those live in `SamplerConfig` (below).
- **Weight = the selection.** A combination with weight `0` (or absent from the mapping) is simply
  not sampled. There is **no separate `select` mask** — inclusion *is* a positive weight. This is
  native to annbatch's `ClassSampler`.
- **Bind(parent, child, common)** — condition the child on the parent: each batch, the child's leaf
  is derived from the parent's leaf by matching the `common` column values. With `common` = the
  context (cell line, …), the child (control/source) is drawn from the **same context** as the parent
  (perturbed/target). This is the source↔target matching.
- **Scheme** — sources + nodes + a rooted tree of binds + the reproducibility cadence (`seed`,
  `steps_per_pass`). Pure structure. The **root** is the streamed target; bound children are the
  sources.
- **SamplerConfig** — the annbatch read parameters (`batch_size`, `chunk_size`, `preload_nchunks`),
  kept off the `Node` and the `Scheme`. Passed to the loader as one config (all nodes) or a
  `{node_name: SamplerConfig}` mapping (per-node). `batch_size` must match across nodes.
- **DAGClassLoader** — iterates batches. Each node streams through its own `ScheduledClassSampler`.

### Batch contract

```python
{
  "target":    ndarray (B, d),   # root node's streamed rep (Node.key)
  "source":    ndarray (B, d),   # bound child's streamed rep — matched to target's context
  "condition": ndarray (B, e),   # condition_fn(leaf) broadcast over the batch (optional)
}
```
`B == SamplerConfig.batch_size`. Source and target rows always match count. Sparse `X` stays sparse.

---

## 2. Sampling schemes

The "sampling scheme" is entirely the **weights** plus the per-node sampler cadence — nothing is
hardcoded.

**Weight builders** (plain functions returning `{combo: weight}`; use them or write the dict yourself):

| helper | meaning |
|---|---|
| `uniform(combos)` | every combination equally likely |
| `frequency(counts)` | sample ∝ cell count (favor abundant conditions) |
| `inverse_frequency(counts)` | sample ∝ 1 / cell count (balance rare vs abundant) |

**`ScheduledClassSampler`** — the one genuinely new piece. It is an annbatch `ClassSampler` whose
per-batch category can be *supplied* (`set_schedule`) instead of drawn internally. It does **not copy**
annbatch's chunk math: `ClassSampler._iter_requests` makes exactly one *weighted* draw
(`rng.choice(n_classes, size=n_groups, p=…)`) to choose each group's class, so `ScheduledClassSampler`
runs that method unchanged but temporarily wraps `self._rng` so that one call returns the scheduled
positions. Every other draw (run selection, slice starts, shuffling) uses the real generator, so a
scheduled pass is bit-identical to what annbatch would produce for those group classes. That is what
makes the bind work:

- the **root** schedule is drawn from the root's weights (`steps_per_pass` categories, one per batch);
- each **bound child**'s schedule is *derived* from the root's (parent leaf → `common` value →
  matching child leaf; the child's RNG breaks ties / picks a fallback);
- the loaders then zip batch-for-batch with **no per-step reconfiguration**.

With `schedule=None`, `ScheduledClassSampler` is exactly `ClassSampler` (draws ∝ weights) — a strict
superset. (If annbatch exposed a `_group_positions(n_groups)` hook, even the rng-wrapping would go
away and this would be a one-method override — an upstream candidate.)

**Read parameters — `SamplerConfig` (batch / chunk / preload):**

- `batch_size` (`B`): rows per emitted batch (target rows == source rows), so it must be equal across
  nodes; the loader validates this.
- `chunk_size` (default `1`): annbatch read-slice size. `1` = per-row reads (any layout). `>1` =
  contiguous chunked reads for higher on-disk throughput; it assumes each sampled leaf is a contiguous
  run ≥ `chunk_size` (which a condition-sorted collection provides) and must divide `batch_size`.
- `preload_nchunks` (default `batch_size // chunk_size`): chunks per annbatch read window; a larger
  multiple packs more classes into one read.

Pass one `SamplerConfig` (applied to every node) or a `{node_name: SamplerConfig}` mapping (per-node —
e.g. a chunked root and a per-row control).

**Cadence / reproducibility (on the `Scheme`):**

- `steps_per_pass`: batches per with-replacement pass; the loader restarts each pass → effectively
  infinite with a fixed, reproducible restart cadence. Scheme-wide (all nodes restart together).
- `seed`: per-node RNG streams are spawned from one `SeedSequence(seed)` (one independent stream per
  node, by sorted name) so nodes never correlate and the full `(source, target)` sequence is
  reproducible from the seed.

> **On layout / sortedness:** the default (`chunk_size=1`) reads per-row and is indifferent to on-disk
> order. `chunk_size>1` is purely a throughput opt-in for a condition-sorted collection; the loader
> does not police layout — it forwards annbatch's own behavior. Ordering never affects *correctness*
> (matching is recovered from the schedule / columns, not from row order).

## 3. The cellflow case

cellflow trains a conditional flow from a **control** population to a **perturbed** population,
matched within a context, one perturbation condition per batch. That maps directly onto a two-node
scheme built by `perturbation_scheme` (`_schemes.py`):

| cellflow concept | dagloader |
|---|---|
| `sample_rep` (`X` / an obsm key) | `Node.key` |
| `split_covariates` (context / grouping) | `context` → the `Bind.common` columns |
| `perturbation_covariates` columns | `perturbation` → the extra `cols` on both nodes |
| `control_key` / which cells are control | `control_values` → which combos land in the `ctrl` node |
| control = same group as target | `Bind("pert", "ctrl", common=context)` |
| one perturbation per batch, weighted | root `pert` node weights + `ScheduledClassSampler` |
| `batch_size` | `SamplerConfig.batch_size` |
| `perturbation_covariate_reps` (embeddings) | `condition_fn(leaf) -> embedding` |

```python
from scaleflow.dagloader import DAGClassLoader, SamplerConfig, perturbation_scheme

scheme = perturbation_scheme(
    adata_or_collection,
    context=["cell_line"],          # split_covariates
    perturbation=["drug"],          # perturbation_covariates
    control_values={"drug": "control"},
    key="X",                        # sample_rep
    seed=0,
)
loader = DAGClassLoader(
    scheme,
    SamplerConfig(batch_size=256),          # or chunk_size=… for chunked on-disk reads
    condition_fn=lambda leaf: DRUG_EMB[leaf[-1]],
)
batch = next(loader)  # {"target", "source", "condition"} — source is a matched-cell-line control
```

**How cellflow uses it.** The collection/streaming path is **additive** to cellflow's in-memory
`adata` + `perturbation_covariates` API — add `perturbation_scheme` + `DAGClassLoader` as a new
dataloader alongside the existing ones (see `docs/perturbation_combinations.md` → "minimal churn").
The condition encoding (categorical embeddings, combinations, pooling) stays in the model; the loader
only needs a `condition_fn` that turns a leaf tuple into the per-condition embedding.

## 4. The sc-flow-tools cases

sc-flow-tools already owns grouping (`HierarchicalIndexer`), matching (`control_values_dict`,
`matched_keys`), representations, and an in-memory multi-node `TrainSampler`. The one thing it lacks
is **out-of-core streaming**. `DAGClassLoader` is exactly that streaming sampler: its scheme
reproduces what a `DataManager` config already describes, reading cells from a `DatasetCollection`
instead of holding them in memory.

| sc-flow-tools concept | dagloader |
|---|---|
| `HierarchicalIndexer` grouping (obs Categorical codes) | `Node.cols` → leaves (obs-only, computed at build) |
| `control_values_dict` (which values are control) | the `ctrl` node's weighted combos (zero-weight = excluded) |
| default same-context coupling (one-to-many) | `Bind(..., common=context)` |
| `matched_keys` (explicit fixed source→target pairing) | a `Bind` whose `common` covers the pairing columns, so parent leaf → child leaf is forced |
| `sample_rep` in PCA space (an obsm key) | `Node.key = "obsm/X_pca"` |
| `*_reps` (uns embedding tables) | `condition_fn(leaf)` (concatenate per-covariate embeddings) |
| weighted / multi-node `TrainSampler` | root weights + a rooted tree of binds |

**Direct scheme construction** (the sc-flow-tools style — assemble nodes from a `DataManager` config):

```python
from scaleflow.dagloader import Bind, DAGClassLoader, Node, SamplerConfig, Scheme, uniform

# grouping columns: context (cell_line) + perturbation (drug); state read from a PCA obsm key
cols = ("cell_line", "drug")
scheme = Scheme(
    sources={"data": collection},
    nodes={
        "target":  Node("data", cols, key="obsm/X_pca", weights=uniform(perturbed_combos)),
        "control": Node("data", cols, key="obsm/X_pca", weights=uniform(control_combos)),
    },
    root="target",
    binds=(Bind("target", "control", common=("cell_line",)),),  # control_values_dict + same-context
    seed=0,
)
loader = DAGClassLoader(
    scheme,
    SamplerConfig(batch_size=256),                       # or {"target": SamplerConfig(..., chunk_size=32), "control": SamplerConfig(...)}
    condition_fn=lambda leaf: concat(cell_emb[leaf[0]], drug_emb[leaf[1]]),  # *_reps combination
)
batch = next(loader)  # {"target", "source", "condition"}
```

**How sc-flow-tools uses it.** Per the shared-data-layer plan (`docs/shared-data-layer-status.md`),
sc-flow-tools hosts the shared data layer and CellFlow2 depends on it. In that plan the tree nodes
carry **row indices** (obs-only), and the annbatch loader (this package's `DAGClassLoader`) streams
the sampled indices from a `DatasetCollection`. The `TrainSampler`'s node dispatch becomes a scheme:
each node → a `Node`, the matched-subpopulation tree → the binds, `control_values_dict` → weights,
`matched_keys` → binds with pairing columns in `common`.

### What is and isn't in this prototype

- **In:** single-level bind (root + one bound child) matched on shared columns; a single streamed rep
  per node (`X` / obsm / layer); categorical condition via `condition_fn`; in-memory and out-of-core
  sources; weighted per-condition sampling; per-node `SamplerConfig`; reproducible per-node RNG.
- **Documented mapping, not yet wired:** multi-child trees emit a single `source` today (the batch
  contract would grow a `sources[child_name]` map); **per-cell continuous covariates / Gromov
  `state_lin`+`state_quad`** (multiple aligned reps for the same streamed rows) would need annbatch to
  return several reps per batch, or a second aligned read — deliberately left out rather than
  reintroduce a bespoke row-gather sampler.
